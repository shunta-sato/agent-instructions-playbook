# COMMANDS.md — canonical build/test/lint commands

This repo is a template.
Replace each `<fill>` with the correct command(s) for your project.

## Build
- build (debug): <fill>
- build (release): <fill>

## Format / Lint / Static analysis
- format: <fill>
- lint: <fill>
- static analysis: <fill>

## Tests
- unit tests: <fill>
- integration/e2e tests: <fill>

## Notes
- If a command differs between local and CI, document both.
- If a command is intentionally unavailable, explain the alternative.
