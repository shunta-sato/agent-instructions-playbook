# CHANGELOG v4.3.2

## Highlights
- Added `staged-lowering` skill: IR/DSL-first, multi-pass lowering workflow for strict-constraint implementations with per-pass verification logs.
- Integrated staged lowering into `dev-workflow` and `quality-gate` as a conditional mandatory step when strict constraints apply.
- Added VS Code prompt file `/staged-lowering` for consistent invocation.
- Updated REFERENCES with AscendCraft (arXiv:2601.22760).
