# UIDesign Review Notes (export destination)

## How to collect feedback
Use Preview `Review Mode` to click elements and add comments, then export as JSON/Markdown.
This file is the destination format after export (or copy/paste), not a manual-only worksheet.

Write each item as:
- Page: (components.html | entry.html | form.html | status.html)
- Element: (button/input/alert/card/typography/etc)
- State: (default/disabled/loading/error/focus)
- Change: (what to change, concrete)
- Reason: (why, short)

Avoid “looks bad” only. Always anchor to a page + element + change.
