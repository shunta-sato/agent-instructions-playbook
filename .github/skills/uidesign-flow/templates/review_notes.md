# UIDesign Review Notes (human)

## How to write feedback
Write each item as:
- Page: (components.html | entry.html | form.html | status.html)
- Element: (button/input/alert/card/typography/etc)
- State: (default/disabled/loading/error/focus)
- Change: (what to change, concrete)
- Reason: (why, short)

Avoid “looks bad” only. Always anchor to a page + element + change.
